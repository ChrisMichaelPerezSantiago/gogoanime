### üì£Read this please | To get the videos!üì£
## api.animeEpisodeHandler([id])

*First of all I must mention that the url of the videos work only using the iframe element.*
*To get the videos (servers) of each chapter, you only need to use the `api.animeEpisodeHandler` function that receives the id of the episode as a parameter.* 
*To verify the id of each episode, look at the episodes property:*

```json
 "episodes": 
    [
      { "id": "high-score-girl-ii-episode-1"  },
      { "id": "high-score-girl-ii-episode-2"  },
      { "id": "high-score-girl-ii-episode-3"  },
      { "id": "high-score-girl-ii-episode-4"  },
      { "id": "high-score-girl-ii-episode-5"  },
      { "id": "high-score-girl-ii-episode-6"  }
    ]
```

*You just have to pass the id of the episode*

```javascript
api.animeEpisodeHandler('high-score-girl-ii-episode-1')
  .then(res =>{
    console.log(res)
  });
```
